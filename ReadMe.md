<h1> NEWSWRITING HELPER FUNCTIONS </h1>
With these helper fucntions I've written, you can summarize huge documents within a set word count. Keep in mind however,that the target wordcount needs to be within reason.

So do not try to summarize a 5000 word document in 10 words.

At the moment, I have only implemented it to read .txt files, but I will be expanding on this shortly. 
I will also be building a GUI for this code logic.
